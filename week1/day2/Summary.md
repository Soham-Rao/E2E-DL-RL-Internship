### ii. **Data Requirements**

* **Traditional ML**:
    - Performs well with smaller, structured datasets.
* **Neural Networks**: 
    - Require large datasets to avoid underfitting. 
    - perform better as data volume increases.

---

### iii. **Computational Resources**

* **Traditional ML**: 
    - Lightweight
    - Can run on CPUs efficiently.
* **Neural Networks**:
    - Heavier computation 
    - Training requires GPUs or TPUs for efficiency.

### iv. **Training Time**

* **Traditional ML**: 
    - Typically faster to train.
* **Neural Networks**: 
    - Slower due to high model complexity and data volume.

### v. **Examples of Algorithms**


* **Traditional ML**: 
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
    - K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forest
* **Neural Networks**: 
    - Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
    - General Adverserial Networks (GANs)
    - Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)

## 2. When Deep Learning (DL) Outperforms Traditional ML

### i. **High-Dimensional Unstructured Data**

* **Examples**: 
    - Images 
    - audio 
    - video 
    - text
* **Advantage**: 
    - CNNs and RNNs excel at automatic feature extraction and pattern recognition in such data.

### ii. **Self Learning Tasks**

* **Examples**: 
    - Speech-to-text 
    - image captioning 
    - machine translation.
* **Advantage**: 
    - No need for handcrafted features, the network learns the mapping directly from raw input to output.

### iii. **Complex Nonlinear Relationships**

* **Examples**: 
    - Financial time series forecasting
    - game-playing agents (like AlphaGo, AlphaZero).
* **Advantage**: 
    - Deep architectures can approximate very complex functions better than shallow models.

### iv. **Transfer Learning**

* **Examples**: 
    - Using pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, ResNet) and fine-tuning them for specific tasks.
* **Advantage**: 
    - Reduces training time and data requirements for new tasks.

### v. **Differences between Neural networks and DL** 

| Feature                     | Basic Neural Network (Shallow NN)       | Deep Neural Network (DNN)                        |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Number of Hidden Layers** | Typically 1                             | 2 or more                                        |
| **Model Complexity**        | Low to moderate                         | High                                             |
| **Feature Extraction**      | Limited                                 | Learns hierarchical features                     |
| **Representation Power**    | Limited for complex patterns            | Can model very complex and abstract patterns     |
| **Training Time**           | Relatively fast                         | Longer due to depth and parameter count          |
| **Risk of Overfitting**     | Lower (on small data)                   | Higher, needs regularization or more data        |
| **Hardware Requirements**   | Can run on CPU                          | Often requires GPU or TPU                        |
| **Use Cases**               | Simple classification, regression tasks | Image recognition, NLP, speech, generative tasks |
| **Interpretability**        | More interpretable                      | Less interpretable                               |
